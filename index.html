      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>What am I doing here?  How did we get this far?  How did I wait this long to learn this skill?  I currently hold a B.S. in Environmental Science from the University of Washington.  But, to get to now, you would have to know that after I finished my degree, I decided that I should embrace my love of the outdoors.  So I became a ski and snowboard instructor in the winters and a kayak guide in the summers.  It was in my time at Stevens Pass that I met the love of my life and decided to start a family.  Having traveled the path of immediacy in terms of work and a stable life, I find myself at a crossroads.  Coding, programming, developing have always been intriguing to me, and I have taken the step to further myself and by extension, my family, and by further extension, my future employer.  I love learning; something about it brings a focus and a drive that can be hard to find in everyday suburban life.  If you made it this far thanks, now lets get to work! </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in Austin, TX.  </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Depends on the weather!  Skiing, snowboarding, and anything that slides down hills on snow.  Paddle boarding, biking (mtn and road), hiking.  I enjoy taking in a good video game, and playing minecraft with my family and friends.  Oh yeah, and food - I love good food.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be something that combines my white collar and blue collar sides.  I don't mind getting dirty.  I also don't mind sitting and typing, reading, problem solving for extended periods.  Something that makes me unique is my ability to thrive in both environments with a calm, but assured demeanor.  So, the answer is - my dream job is one that accentuates who I am as a full person, not just one part of me.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently residing in Bothell, WA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to see what I do... The possibilities are endless.  You can make something that can literally impact the world around us in a positive manner.  You can also make a website that helps people make memes.  Both impact the global and local communities in different manners, and its the diversity of what people need at any time that makes it interesting.  How will I spend my time?  Something serious, something aloof; thruthfull both are a part of me, so the answer lies somewhere in between.</p>
